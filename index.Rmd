```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Introduction

This simple app is created to allow users to predict the eruption time in the Yellowstone Old Faithful geyser dataset. 

## App Structure

- Input: one numeric input from the user to specify how many second of waiting time to put in the model
- Output: one numeric output from the linear model fitted by the app
- Documentation: brief instruction tab

## Code

Here's what's behind the secene being calculated by the server. For example, if the user input 80 seconds, the app should produce:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
data(faithful)
model <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data=faithful)
predict(model, newdata = data.frame(waiting = 80))
```
